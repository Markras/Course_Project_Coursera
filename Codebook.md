run_analysis.r
v.1.0

For the description of how script is working, see README.

In order to run the file run_analysis.r and get the final tidy set you have to setwd() to the directory you have files: x_train, x_test, subject_train, subject_test, y_train, y_test, features, activity_labels

Following steps from README you can merge them into a single mergedData, and then extract and rearrange it to get the final dataset. 

The first two columns in the tidy dataset correspond to a subject ID (30 in total) and to an activity (WALKING
, WALKING_UPSTAIRS
, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
, SITTING
, STANDING
, LAYING
). For each combination of subject Id and activity there is one measurement per mean obtained in run_analysis.R. The exact procedure is in the README file. 

The means of columns from the original files concern different kind of measurements that are described in a more or less clear way in the original files. I reproduce here the explications delivered by the original files: 


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:
